      <description>While I continue to work on the mobile application I’m creating for work, I rewrote the entire framework so that its much better organized. I also decided to integrate Marionette.js which was absolutely worth while. It took a little bit to figure it out, but the savings in time after the fact are huge! Writing simple views and collections now is a no brainer (almost to the point that I feel bad because it feels like cheating!</description>

      <description>Soft launched ImGettin.it over the weekend! By soft launch, I mean, bought and setup the domain, and got a test version of the site live. Login works, and the site “works” for the most part, but is very much not ready for prime time yet. I still need to get a lot of things working and most importantly I need a basic admin for the games database. The data that&amp;#8217;s up right now is just test seed data &amp;#8211; while pretty solid is far from complete or even valid.</description>

      <description>Had a great Christmas/New Years break (well went back to work for 2 days in between there)!! Enjoyed the time off and just spending time with the little one and generally doing nothing productive!
I did find time during the break to spend an entire day working with @Answer7 doing a little mini hackathon! This was something that we have been toying with for a while &amp;#8211; the basic premise is that you and a few friends lock yourself in a room for an entire day and try to create something from scratch!</description>
