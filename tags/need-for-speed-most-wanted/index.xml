      <description>Hurricane Sandy!!!
Installed Windows 8 over the weekend. At first, it was a little jarring. The changes are sweeping. Im not sure how I feel still about basically the start menu being expanded to an entire screen &amp;#8211; which is basically what happened. The live tiles concept is neat. I&amp;#8217;m not really a fan of forcing “metro” style apps to run full screen &amp;#8211; as I have a fairly large screen and typically development environments are the only programs I ever run maximized.</description>
