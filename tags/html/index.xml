      <description>I struggled with a minor issue in HTML for a few hours off an on during a project that was just really bothering me. Basically, I had a few LIs that I was displaying as inline-block (horizontally stacked side by side):
[sourcecode lang=&amp;#8221;html&amp;#8221;]
 Item 1 Item 1 Item 1  [/sourcecode]
When the rows would naturally wrap, there was a tiny gap between rows (as if there was a top margin or padding).</description>

      <description>Attended a Philly Tech Meetup in Center City (Market Street &amp;#8211; Science Center). Was very informative, and definitely will not be the last!
Learned about autocomplete=”off” as an HTML attribute. Was having an issue with validation where the browser was prepopulating the New Password field in the form with what was saved for the users login credentials. This was throwing the error because New Password (auto completed) didnt match the corresponding Confirm Password (which was naturally blank).</description>
