      <description>So I spent most of 2 days working through trying to figure out Ember.js. (I know previously I said I was going to focus on Backbone, but I wanted to stick with Ember one more day and try to see it through.) Granted, I’m totally new to this whole MV* side of JavaScript. I had decided that Ember was just the way to go. Sadly, after 2 full days of playing around I&amp;#8217;ve given up (for now) and decided to start focusing on Backbone.</description>

      <description>Played through all of the co-op missions in Far Cry 3 with @AnswerSeven and that was a lot of fun. It was an honor being a part of his completing 1000&amp;frasl;1000 in that game! Well done!!
Looks like we might have a real project at work to use the Kinect with: our users group meeting we host every year, with over 5000 in attendance. I came up with an idea that I think might be pretty interesting, all really for the purposes of allowing me an opportunity to work with the Kinect.</description>

      <description>This week and the past have been spent a lot with XNA 4.0 (Xbox Live Indie game development). I did a little bit of work on a project and started looking for good sprite assets for a test game. My idea is to create a DayZ type game but overhead 2D using Zombies Ate My Neighbors! style graphics (in fact the actual sprite sheets from that game itself). Found some great resources for the sprites.</description>
