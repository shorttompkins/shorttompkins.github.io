      <description>Shortly after getting my Chromebook, I quickly realized that it was a bit lacking. Sure, I wrote earlier that its a great little device and perfect for surfing &amp;#8211; but I also sort of wanted something a tiny bit more. So a little bit of searching lead me toan article explaining how you can very easily install Ubuntu Linux (well a port specifically for Chromebooks) on the device! The process itself was super painless and very easy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had a bug in my ear lately that I wanted something&amp;#8230; different&amp;#8230; than the iPad for general home usage and Internet surfing etc. I sort of wanted a laptop, but just didn&amp;#8217;t want to pay the money for one. I was looking at some budget ultra-books but even those come in around $800+. There&amp;#8217;s the Surface tablets, but the Pros are also $1200+ and the RT just seems like an iPad basically.</description>
