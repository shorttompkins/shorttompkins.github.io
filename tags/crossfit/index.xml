      <description>I have successfully finished the Philadelphia Tough Mudder 2013! Not only did I finish, I completed every obstacle! My only problem was the distance / terrain &amp;#8211; it was just way too rough and my knees failed me very early on which lead me to wind up walking more than half the course in incredible pain. But I completed the course!!

I will say, honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think I ever would want to do it again.</description>

      <description>After 8 long weeks, my cycle with the Barbell Club at Crossfit Generation has come to an end. The entire experience was absolutely incredible, and being that it was my first exposure to true weightlifting I can definitely say without a doubt that I&amp;#8217;m hooked.
In this particular program, the cycle lasts 8 weeks with mandatory 2 days per week. My schedule was Thursday evenings at 6pm and Saturday mornings at 9am, same times every week.</description>

      <description>If you’re like most people, one of your New Year’s resolutions is to start working out!
However, its no surprise that most local gym memberships skyrocket in January, but attendance is back to regular levels by February.
I&amp;#8217;ve tried working out on and off for years, and its just always been something I&amp;#8217;ve struggled with and never ever succeeded at. I tried the local gym, I tried Xbox Kinect workout “games”, I tried in-home gyms, I tried running using Nike+, I tried just going to the local park.</description>

      <description>Got the Nexus 4 today and I&amp;#8217;m completely blown away!! Coming from the iPhone4 its literally night and day! I spent probably 4 hours with it tonight just playing around with settings, tinkering with the live wallpapers, and getting my apps installed and all setup. The thing is VERY smooth, and runs like a champ. I&amp;#8217;ve been using it so heavily that I can’t truly speak for the battery yet, as I’ve been killing it and watching it drain.</description>

      <description>Finally wrapped up the big project at work. Had to have my laptop rebuilt since installing VS2012 broke AD authentication in our app. That made for an interesting debug scenario while we tried to push live and fix bugs!
Started Crossfit! The first class of the on-ramp program really kicked my ass. I thought for sure I was going to throw up by the end, but I hung in there and honestly I think I did pretty well.</description>
