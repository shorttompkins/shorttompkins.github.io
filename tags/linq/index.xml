      <description>Created and launched TumblingInferno.com. Was an awesome rapid prototype going from start to launch in 2 days. Implemented a lot of LINQ which was great experience as well as reacquainting myself with Entity Framework. Super excited that I was finally able to finish and launch something!
Attempted to play with Angular.js, and was somewhat successful. Although didnt really work for the project the way I was hoping &amp;#8211; and help online is scarce currently.</description>
