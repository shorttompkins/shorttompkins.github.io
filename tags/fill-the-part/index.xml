      <description>Started coding &amp;#8220;Secret&amp;#8221; website (still not happy with the name)!! Going with a basic 3 tier structure for now &amp;#8211; Domain, Services, and UX. Made good progress so far on the Domain model, and the underlying foundation for the Services layer.
Found and worked with a great tiny little jQuery plugin for working with cookies. Was super easy to use and implemented, and even worked with jQuery 1.3 in a legacy system I needed it in!</description>

      <description>Absolute total nightmare at the end of the week as we pushed a new build to production and were impacted with a ton of problems. Mainly the issue resides in the fact that the current setup of the applications is a configuration/deployment nightmare &amp;#8211; with way too many steps and settings involved leading to way too many opened ended possibilities for user error.
Learned about the [attr] selector in jQuery &amp;#8211; basically to detect the presense of an actual attribute in an html element.</description>

      <description>After being stumped for a while with a particularly interesting issue in MVC &amp;#8211; I found the solution on Rick Strahl’s blog. Specifically I was trying to change the values of a view model from a controller action, after PostBack &amp;#8211; yet my changes seemed to be ignored or simply refuse to stick. Turns out the HtmlHelpers refer to the actual POST data on page load after postback (seemingly ignoring the “model” even though you explicitly refer to the model when using HtmlHelpers).</description>

      <description>Did a lot of cleanup and additional (new) functionality for Fill the Part.
Created a really need widget that loads activity stream every 25secs, loading newest at top with a sliding stack animation, while the bottom one slides up (squished).
Continued to play with jsRender.</description>
