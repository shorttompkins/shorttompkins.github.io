      <description>I completed the Code School course on using Google Chrome Dev Tools. I highly recommend you complete this course &amp;#8211; its super quick (probably no longer than 1 hour) and very easy. Yet, I learned a lot. Specifically with the more advanced topics of the dev tools like Profiling, Memory Leaks, Framerates, etc.
Started writing my hybrid mobile app for work &amp;#8211; learned quite a bit along the way. Working with jQuery Mobile, but its overhead and conventions/takeover is making it less than desirable &amp;#8211; perhaps Iâ€™ll rewrite the transition animations manually and implement 3rd party Touch/Tap library.</description>
