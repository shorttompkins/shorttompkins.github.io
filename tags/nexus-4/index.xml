      <description>Got the Nexus 4 today and I&amp;#8217;m completely blown away!! Coming from the iPhone4 its literally night and day! I spent probably 4 hours with it tonight just playing around with settings, tinkering with the live wallpapers, and getting my apps installed and all setup. The thing is VERY smooth, and runs like a champ. I&amp;#8217;ve been using it so heavily that I can’t truly speak for the battery yet, as I’ve been killing it and watching it drain.</description>

      <description>Installed Web Essentials 1.7 for VS2012 at home and tried out Zen Coding. This is definitely something really awesome and something I wish was integrated a long time ago. As it stands, I don&amp;#8217;t know how much “raw html” I will be coding in the near future to warrant using it all that much &amp;#8211; but I guess any html coding is worth doing via Zen Coding!
Finally spent some time and started doing the Pluralsight course on Backbone.</description>
