      <description>I was very excited for the big reveal from Microsoft, and literally was counting down the days. When it finally arrived, I could hardly contain myself!
My initial reaction was that I was somewhat underwhelmed, but generally excited and liked everything I saw during the presentation (even though I could very easily admit that they just didn&amp;#8217;t show enough). The TV integration stuff I thought was very neat, and more importantly the pure speed of how everything worked on the system really wowed me and put to rest the biggest complaint I have with the current generation: how slow/long everything seems to take &amp;#8220;using&amp;#8221; the system.</description>
