      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve been spending a lot of my free time absorbing as much as I can about an exciting Functional Programming language called Elixir.  For those of you that don&amp;#8217;t know, Elixir is somewhat of a spiritual successor to Ruby, and therefore Phoenix (the web framework for Elixir) could be considered it&amp;#8217;s Rails.  Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at my learning path and what you can do if you&amp;#8217;re interested in becoming a proficient Elixir &amp;amp; Phoenix developer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago I &lt;a href=&#34;https://kroltech.com/2015/10/15/getting-started-with-react-and-flux/&#34;&gt;started an ambitious project&lt;/a&gt; to create a website from scratch using React and Flux (Redux) as well as Node.js and MongoDB.  I was also writing a companion book parallel to writing the actual code for the project and made some really good progress.  Since I basically stopped completely and just let the book sit and linger, I decided that I should at least open source the book so you can check it out and hopefully learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do rapid releases at AWeber so we’re constantly pushing code changes to our users. To be sure that we aren’t in a constant state of “fix 1 bug, introduce 2 more” we embrace TDD across our entire stack. This includes making sure our front-end JavaScript code has thorough test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Call me impressed. Looks like Kickstarter actually works! I backed the game &lt;a href=&#34;http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shadowrun Returns&lt;/a&gt; probably over a year ago, and if you hadn&amp;#8217;t heard it actually released! And on top of that, its a damn fine game! Its exactly what I expected, although I don&amp;#8217;t think some people fully knew what to expect so might have been disappointed with the game in the end (unfortunately, that&amp;#8217;s more of a misunderstanding on their part or off-base/unrealistic expectations).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have a simple jQuery onClick event bound to a link. On the load of the page, I fetch existing data from a cookie and then call the onClick manually to setup the page (for returning visitors). There is some animation associated with the click &amp;#8211; but when the page loads and all of the clicks are registered, the animations look odd and out of sync (and just logically dont make sense in that situation).</description>

      <description>I have successfully finished the Philadelphia Tough Mudder 2013! Not only did I finish, I completed every obstacle! My only problem was the distance / terrain &amp;#8211; it was just way too rough and my knees failed me very early on which lead me to wind up walking more than half the course in incredible pain. But I completed the course!!

I will say, honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think I ever would want to do it again.</description>

      <description>I was very excited for the big reveal from Microsoft, and literally was counting down the days. When it finally arrived, I could hardly contain myself!
My initial reaction was that I was somewhat underwhelmed, but generally excited and liked everything I saw during the presentation (even though I could very easily admit that they just didn&amp;#8217;t show enough). The TV integration stuff I thought was very neat, and more importantly the pure speed of how everything worked on the system really wowed me and put to rest the biggest complaint I have with the current generation: how slow/long everything seems to take &amp;#8220;using&amp;#8221; the system.</description>

      <description>While I continue to work on the mobile application I’m creating for work, I rewrote the entire framework so that its much better organized. I also decided to integrate Marionette.js which was absolutely worth while. It took a little bit to figure it out, but the savings in time after the fact are huge! Writing simple views and collections now is a no brainer (almost to the point that I feel bad because it feels like cheating!</description>

      <description>For the past few months I&amp;#8217;ve been seeing more and more about node.js popping up all over the place. I installed it and dabbled a few months ago, but never really spent more than an hour and honestly didn&amp;#8217;t walk away very impressed (my own fault, really). This past week I decided to really give it another shot, really trying to dig into it and actually accomplish something. This also sparked by my discovery of Koding.</description>

I say this because, for all intents and purposes, I am a typical “.net developer”. Every recruiter I get a call from always has a “great .net opportunity that you would be perfect for!”.

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a quick tip. If you have text that contains urls (i.e. tweets) and want the urls in the text to appear as actual links via HTML, use the following RegEx:
[sourcecode lang=&amp;#8221;javascript&amp;#8221;]
var message = &amp;ldquo;Here is some tweet text. Check out: http://www.google.com&amp;quot;;
var exp = /(b(https?|ftp|file)://[-A-Z0-9+&amp;amp;@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Z0-9+&amp;amp;@#/%=~_|])/ig;
message = message.replace(exp, &amp;ldquo;$1&amp;rdquo;);
[/sourcecode]

      <description>Shortly after getting my Chromebook, I quickly realized that it was a bit lacking. Sure, I wrote earlier that its a great little device and perfect for surfing &amp;#8211; but I also sort of wanted something a tiny bit more. So a little bit of searching lead me toan article explaining how you can very easily install Ubuntu Linux (well a port specifically for Chromebooks) on the device! The process itself was super painless and very easy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had a bug in my ear lately that I wanted something&amp;#8230; different&amp;#8230; than the iPad for general home usage and Internet surfing etc. I sort of wanted a laptop, but just didn&amp;#8217;t want to pay the money for one. I was looking at some budget ultra-books but even those come in around $800+. There&amp;#8217;s the Surface tablets, but the Pros are also $1200+ and the RT just seems like an iPad basically.</description>

      <description>Great article on why there aren&amp;#8217;t more great “web apps” and the difference between an “App” and an “app”. Dan Whalin provides us an excellent introduction to AngularJS. The video is about 60 minutes, but covers a lot of ground and is a great introduction. After I&amp;#8217;ve been spending some time with Backbone, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking more and more about maybe making the move onto Angular or Ember &amp;#8211; a lot of the Microsoft evangelists seem to be pushing Angular lately &amp;#8211; Pluralsight courses are coming very soon!</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re like me, you have a fair amount of sites that you visit on a daily basis. Personally, I love the Bookmark bar (on Chrome, Firefox, etc). However, you cant really fit a whole lot of sites before you hit the end (width) of the browser and typically get the double arrow &amp;#8220;more&amp;#8221; dropdown.
Well a quick tip is to simply remove the text for all of the bookmarks that have a favicon set (which is probably 90% of them).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working on a project, that requires a number of different animations based on user events. I recently switched all of the animations to CSS3 transforms and transitions versus jQuery animations. The improvement has been staggering, to say the least.
However, I came across a weird issue today. When attempting to fade an element in after a click event, the element just kept popping into place. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t fade. After some investigation I realized that my jQuery was setting the opacity to 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working hard on preparing a mobile app prototype for a demonstration/proposal next week. The goal is to create a native app using HTML5 and PhoneGap. I&amp;#8217;ve been building the app using Backbone primarily, and using Adobe’s PhoneGap Build. PhoneGap Build is a cloud based compilation tool that makes things VERY easy to get your app up and running natively. The build tool supports iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, HP, and a few others.</description>

      <description>I completed the Code School course on using Google Chrome Dev Tools. I highly recommend you complete this course &amp;#8211; its super quick (probably no longer than 1 hour) and very easy. Yet, I learned a lot. Specifically with the more advanced topics of the dev tools like Profiling, Memory Leaks, Framerates, etc.
Started writing my hybrid mobile app for work &amp;#8211; learned quite a bit along the way. Working with jQuery Mobile, but its overhead and conventions/takeover is making it less than desirable &amp;#8211; perhaps I’ll rewrite the transition animations manually and implement 3rd party Touch/Tap library.</description>

In my previous post, we discussed the original idea for the project, outlined what its supposed to do, and started dissecting the project&amp;#8217;s main.js and app.js files. Both of those files frequently referred to the &amp;#8220;Games&amp;#8221; Backbone view and collection, but never really explained them.</description>

      <description>After 8 long weeks, my cycle with the Barbell Club at Crossfit Generation has come to an end. The entire experience was absolutely incredible, and being that it was my first exposure to true weightlifting I can definitely say without a doubt that I&amp;#8217;m hooked.
In this particular program, the cycle lasts 8 weeks with mandatory 2 days per week. My schedule was Thursday evenings at 6pm and Saturday mornings at 9am, same times every week.</description>

      <description>Found a neat little JavaScript tool (that&amp;#8217;s right, Vanilla!) called Enquire.js for detecting Media Query triggers in CSS. This could be cool for triggering events (like animation) when you have certain components of your page depending on different media queries. Even though those triggers typically only occur on resize/resolution change &amp;#8211; it could also be used to detect orientation change (i.e. iPad rotate from portrait to landscape).
While researching some stuff for an upcoming mobile web app I need to create I found this handy JavaScript tool for storing to Local Storage called jStorage.</description>

      <description>Perhaps this is common knowledge, but I just figured it out (accidentally) and its pretty damn awesome! If you maintain a regular .js file, and then create a copy of it .min.js with a compressed copy of your code, Visual Studio will maintain that minified version automatically whenever you make changes to your original! It will create a .map file that it uses to keep track of the differences between your source and minified versions (variable names, etc).</description>

Very inspirational!!
While poking around the source code for the 2013 Beercamp website game I discovered Raphael.js, a simple JavaScript library that makes working with vector in HTML a breeze!</description>

      <description>I had been anticipating the new reboot of Tomb Raider for quite some time, pretty much since they originally revealed it. I thought it looked extremely impressive, and being touted as an Uncharted clone was perfectly fine with me! As always, I had my doubts because hype is getting worse and worse in the gaming industry, and honestly the last year has felt like nothing but letdown after letdown. Once I popped the game in and experienced the first hour all of my concerns were gone.</description>

      <description>I continue to plug away at my Backbone.js project (rewriting imgettin.it from scratch basically). I&amp;#8217;ve hit a shitload of road blocks, but most of them were related to my having to completely rethink how to handle a certain area or aspect to make it more efficient &amp;#8211; and then wrap my head around how to accomplish this new concept using Backbone.js. I would say its taken me probably a solid 4-6 nights of coding to get to the point that I don’t feel utterly lost and coding is coming more fluent now (versus stutters as with most new languages/concepts).</description>

      <description>I started going through the process of deconstructing John Papa’s amazing CodeCamper Single Page Application project and trying to break it down to a basic stripped down project template. I love a lot of what was accomplished in that project (great DI, awesome Repositories and patterns, etc.)! While breaking down the project, I&amp;#8217;ve learned quite a bit. I&amp;#8217;ve posted the full source of the template to my github, but its still a work in progress.</description>

      <description>While playing with the SPA project template (post forthcoming) I finally took some time to play around with Require.js. While its fairly easy to get started, it blew my mind how it almost instantly changed my mindset and habits with regard to organization of my code. At its most basic level, it allows you to break all of your code down into nice bite-sized chunks in individual files &amp;#8211; but its so much more.</description>

      <description>The .Net framework 2012.2 update has been released. Most of this update has to do with a few minor tweaks and enhancements (color coding popular client-side templates, LESS support, etc) as well as some new templates. A great post on John Papa’s blog outlines the templates.
Played Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and have to say I&amp;#8217;m a little disappointed. Its definitely not Bayonetta, and I doubt Platinum will ever achieve the stunning awesomeness that was that game, but heres holding out hope (not much since last I heard Bayonetta 2 was WiiU exclusive).</description>

      <description>While watching the excellent course on Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery by John Papa over at PluralSight, he dropped a nice little nugget of information that I was totally unaware of.
You can add debugger; as a line by itself in your JavaScript and when your code gets executed by the browser, the browsers built in debugger will stop on that line. Think of it as a way to throw breakpoints right into your code.</description>

      <title>Finishing Last…</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been doing Crossfit for exactly 4 months now. In that time I have seen and experienced a tremendous improvement in my physical fitness and strength. However, I’m still a noob. And never is it more obvious than at the very end of each workout session. I always, consistently, finish in last place. While there is never a feeling of pressure or intense competition, they do post the scores on the whiteboard, and there are leader-boards and you just can’t help but notice when you finish last!</description>

      <description>Created a super basic/handy lift calculator &amp;#8211; I’ll use this initially during my first bunch of sessions until I get comfortable doing the math on the fly. Its just painful trying to do percentage calculations while lifting, and then breaking down those results into how many different weights you need to add to each side of the bar! This tool will compute all of that in one shot!
My Crossfit box started using Wodify.</description>

      <description>I had my first session of the Barbell Club tonight and it was absolutely amazing! I hyped it up in my head for so long and then this past week started really getting nervous for it. My biggest fear was that, even though I&amp;#8217;ve been doing Crossfit for 3 months, I haven’t spent any time doing the actual lifts. We covered the basics of the core lifts during on-ramp (my first month), but that was a crash course and 3 months ago!</description>

      <description>Soft launched ImGettin.it over the weekend! By soft launch, I mean, bought and setup the domain, and got a test version of the site live. Login works, and the site “works” for the most part, but is very much not ready for prime time yet. I still need to get a lot of things working and most importantly I need a basic admin for the games database. The data that&amp;#8217;s up right now is just test seed data &amp;#8211; while pretty solid is far from complete or even valid.</description>

      <description>I was searching for the opposite of the caret, or circumflex, character (^) and couldn&amp;#8217;t really find one. Typically, in a pinch when I&amp;#8217;m mocking, I would just use the caret ^ and a lowercase v &amp;#8211; but they don&amp;#8217;t look the same.
There doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a good opposite for the caret character &amp;#8211; but I found 2 extremely useful HTML character codes to use instead:
∧ (&amp;and;) and ∨ (&amp;or;)</description>

      <description>I was working on a project today, that dealt with a large amount of JSON data. The project needed to allow the user to filter the data by a bunch of different filters and options within those filters.
Initially I started using Underscore.js thinking this would help, but in the interest of time (had to get it done today!!!!) I decided to just do it quick and dirty. Well, I succeeded in the dirty department:</description>

Its an 8 week program that focuses on weight training/lifting with an emphasis on technique and improved individual performance. Luckily I got up because by 9:30 all slots were full!
I&amp;#8217;ve been participating in a “Beard Contest” at work, and I can honestly say that I hate it.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest surprises in casting news this year was the reveal of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. For some, the choice was obvious. Tom Cruise fills seats! And that&amp;#8217;s pretty much all the movie studios want. For others, people like us that actually know the source material, the choice was a huge and obvious mistake.
If you aren&amp;#8217;t familiar with Jack Reacher, the character, he can generally be summarized as being a huge, foreboding, tank of a guy.</description>

      <description>If you’re like most people, one of your New Year’s resolutions is to start working out!
However, its no surprise that most local gym memberships skyrocket in January, but attendance is back to regular levels by February.
I&amp;#8217;ve tried working out on and off for years, and its just always been something I&amp;#8217;ve struggled with and never ever succeeded at. I tried the local gym, I tried Xbox Kinect workout “games”, I tried in-home gyms, I tried running using Nike+, I tried just going to the local park.</description>

      <description>Had a great Christmas/New Years break (well went back to work for 2 days in between there)!! Enjoyed the time off and just spending time with the little one and generally doing nothing productive!
I did find time during the break to spend an entire day working with @Answer7 doing a little mini hackathon! This was something that we have been toying with for a while &amp;#8211; the basic premise is that you and a few friends lock yourself in a room for an entire day and try to create something from scratch!</description>

[sourcecode lang=&amp;#8221;html&amp;#8221;]
 Item 1 Item 1 Item 1  [/sourcecode]
When the rows would naturally wrap, there was a tiny gap between rows (as if there was a top margin or padding).</description>

      <description>This is probably going to be one of my last posts for 2012 so I decided to end with a list of my goals and ambitions for the next year! Personally, I think its very important to always have goals and something to look forward to, but also as something to continuously drive yourself to improve. A goal is a destination, and without a destination you&amp;#8217;re just travelling aimlessly with no clear direction or indication of where to go so, ultimately, you wind up nowhere (or right back where you started).</description>

      <description>Wow! Looking back, this was quite literally a whirlwind year for me! Honestly, the main theme of this year really was self-discovery, learning, and growth! Where to begin&amp;#8230;
At the very end of last year, I personally felt that my passion for my business/partnership was on the downturn. I was struggling with if I even wanted to do it anymore. Then, one of our biggest clients basically told us they were hiring someone full-time and bringing all the work in-house.</description>

      <description>So I spent most of 2 days working through trying to figure out Ember.js. (I know previously I said I was going to focus on Backbone, but I wanted to stick with Ember one more day and try to see it through.) Granted, I’m totally new to this whole MV* side of JavaScript. I had decided that Ember was just the way to go. Sadly, after 2 full days of playing around I&amp;#8217;ve given up (for now) and decided to start focusing on Backbone.</description>

Looks like we might have a real project at work to use the Kinect with: our users group meeting we host every year, with over 5000 in attendance. I came up with an idea that I think might be pretty interesting, all really for the purposes of allowing me an opportunity to work with the Kinect.</description>

      <description>Forgot to mention I picked up Far Cry 3 last week and I&amp;#8217;ve been playing it a lot. Its really a fun game. Very open ended, very sandbox. It seems like they finally nailed the balance with the island, the open ended gameplay, gun play, and fun action (I wanted so much to love Far Cry 2 but it just never happened). There are definitely moments where I’m reminded of Skyrim, which is a good thing!</description>

Good thing your browser is synced and you don&amp;#8217;t really need to worry about it. Well, here&amp;#8217;s a quick tip that will allow you to access that password very easily.
Using any current browser that has Developer tools, access those (F12 usually) and find the Inspector.</description>

      <description>My second JavaScript library in as many days! This new one is called ShiftPanes (like my original names huh?!). Basically, it allows you to declare a container that will hold &amp;#8220;pageable&amp;#8221; blocks of content within it. It is, again, pretty basic and no frills.
Just declare a container with any class you want, and inside declare multiple containers each with the same (different from the container) class that will act as “panes” (or pages).</description>

      <description>This is my first ever public JavaScript “library” and also my first GitHub!
SlideIns.js is just simple jQuery code that allows you to have content on a page “slide in” from left, right, or middle (middle just fades in basically). This concept was taken from Apple.com pages, where they recently started having little subtle animations featured on their pages &amp;#8211; for example as you scroll down an iPad or iPhone might slide in from the right of the screen.</description>

      <description>I finally figured out how to use closures properly in JavaScript. This came as a result of my needing to make sure globals I was defining in different script files weren&amp;#8217;t conflicting with same named globals in other files. My solution was rather simple, just wrap existing chunks of code in their own function wrapper:
Original Code:
Note that the variables globalVar and anotherGlobal are truly GLOBAL and any other javascript file(s) with the same variables declared will cause major issues for our code (or vise versa).</description>

      <description>As a force of habit, I&amp;#8217;ve always just wrapped my JavaScript code in a $(document).ready() and assumed/hoped for the best. I know that this is specifically for when the DOM is ready, and doesn&amp;#8217;t have anything to do with images. However, 99% of the time I&amp;#8217;ve never really been concerned about the status of loaded images.
Today, I came across an issue where during the $(document).ready() I needed to get the TOP position property of an  element.</description>

      <description>I wrote this post for Fill the Part, but thought I&amp;#8217;d post it here as well for posterity:
(These are in release order.)
Zero Dark Thirty
I&amp;#8217;m a sucker for anything military related, with Black Hawk Down being one of my top 5 movies I can watch over and over. Plus, while I didn&amp;#8217;t absolutely love Hurt Locker, Point Break is another one of my all time favorites.

      <description>My continued use of My Fitness Pal (nutrition tracking app) has veered dangerously close to obsession! Literally, it&amp;#8217;s become something of a game. I’m constantly looking at the details on every food and considering how it will effect my “stats” (seriously, as if I’m an MMO character or something)! Ultimately, that&amp;#8217;s a good thing I guess. This past weekend alone I&amp;#8217;ve been doing REALLY really well with my eating. I have a great schedule of meals lined up for the week too, with high protein days stacked for Tuesday and Thursday (Crossfit days).</description>

      <description>Just when I started wondering about doing sprints (and in fact did some 2 weeks ago at the park) they posted on my Crossfit website about the benefits of sprinting and a link to this article. Sounds good to me! Will incorporate for sure on Saturday/Sunday mornings (my non-Crossfit “home based” workout day).
Great blog post on vitamins and supplements to take pre/post workout as well as daily. After some research and discussing with one of the Crossfit coaches, this is my current plan:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve always been interested in some sort of Microsoft certification, and have always had it in the back of my mind to try to complete one of them. This morning I discovered a new track that is perfect and right up my alley; MCSD: Web Applications Developer. Most of the preparation for these exams can be completed via Pluralsight &amp;#8211; so I’m definitely going to try to commit to at least attempting this certification.</description>

      <description>Not many people realize the importance of Pinning tabs in Google Chrome. Sure, it makes the tab smaller and a little more out of the way, but is that it?
Actually, the point of pinned tabs is to treat them like any other &amp;#8220;app&amp;#8221; you have open or running in your system. The important thing to note about pinned tabs is that they will open automatically with your browser the next time you launch it.</description>

      <description>When I started my new job, a few months in I decided to start blogging. At first it really was just for my own personal use, a way for me to keep track of my accomplishments and new things I’d learned. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to get too bogged down and distracted with the trouble of actually creating a blog and designing it &amp;#8211; so instead I created a simple Google document and logged stuff daily and/or weekly.</description>

      <description>Got the Nexus 4 today and I&amp;#8217;m completely blown away!! Coming from the iPhone4 its literally night and day! I spent probably 4 hours with it tonight just playing around with settings, tinkering with the live wallpapers, and getting my apps installed and all setup. The thing is VERY smooth, and runs like a champ. I&amp;#8217;ve been using it so heavily that I can’t truly speak for the battery yet, as I’ve been killing it and watching it drain.</description>

      <description>Installed Web Essentials 1.7 for VS2012 at home and tried out Zen Coding. This is definitely something really awesome and something I wish was integrated a long time ago. As it stands, I don&amp;#8217;t know how much “raw html” I will be coding in the near future to warrant using it all that much &amp;#8211; but I guess any html coding is worth doing via Zen Coding!
Finally spent some time and started doing the Pluralsight course on Backbone.</description>

      <description>Busted my ass in a major workout last night at Crossfit. The regular class is NO JOKE!
Oh yeah, and Obama won (again)!!!
Decided to try another stab at Angular.js this week. Going to try to lab something up at work using it, something real-world like article comments or something.
Continued working on the new Nextgen.com framework. Got the shell set up pretty nicely and did a lot of organization of all Javascript and CSS and how it will be integrated globally and sitewide.</description>

      <description>Hurricane Sandy!!!
Installed Windows 8 over the weekend. At first, it was a little jarring. The changes are sweeping. Im not sure how I feel still about basically the start menu being expanded to an entire screen &amp;#8211; which is basically what happened. The live tiles concept is neat. I&amp;#8217;m not really a fan of forcing “metro” style apps to run full screen &amp;#8211; as I have a fairly large screen and typically development environments are the only programs I ever run maximized.</description>

      <description>After a discussion about the advantages of N-tier archictecture with a coworker and finally truly understanding it all &amp;#8211; I rewrote the backend for &amp;#8220;Secret&amp;#8221; website to fully utilize a Data, Services, Domain, UI architecture. Now it is coming together quite nicely. I’ve completed the basic groundwork for most of the backend, with the Data layer completed, the Repositories at a good start with most basic CRUD functionality complete, and the Services layer tapping into those repositories.</description>

      <description>Started coding &amp;#8220;Secret&amp;#8221; website (still not happy with the name)!! Going with a basic 3 tier structure for now &amp;#8211; Domain, Services, and UX. Made good progress so far on the Domain model, and the underlying foundation for the Services layer.
Found and worked with a great tiny little jQuery plugin for working with cookies. Was super easy to use and implemented, and even worked with jQuery 1.3 in a legacy system I needed it in!</description>

      <description>Spent the weekend spec’ing the “Secret” website, outlining each page, functionality and features. Spent a little time working on the actual domain name, but need to work really hard on figuring that key component out. Found a great article on mashable that will help. Hoping to start coding before the end of the month, so I can focus a big part of November on getting the groundwork done.
Dishonored and X-Com: Enemy Unknown both came out this week.</description>

Started Crossfit! The first class of the on-ramp program really kicked my ass. I thought for sure I was going to throw up by the end, but I hung in there and honestly I think I did pretty well.</description>

      <description>Absolute total nightmare at the end of the week as we pushed a new build to production and were impacted with a ton of problems. Mainly the issue resides in the fact that the current setup of the applications is a configuration/deployment nightmare &amp;#8211; with way too many steps and settings involved leading to way too many opened ended possibilities for user error.
Learned about the [attr] selector in jQuery &amp;#8211; basically to detect the presense of an actual attribute in an html element.</description>

      <description>Attended a Philly Tech Meetup in Center City (Market Street &amp;#8211; Science Center). Was very informative, and definitely will not be the last!
Learned about autocomplete=”off” as an HTML attribute. Was having an issue with validation where the browser was prepopulating the New Password field in the form with what was saved for the users login credentials. This was throwing the error because New Password (auto completed) didnt match the corresponding Confirm Password (which was naturally blank).</description>

      <description>After being stumped for a while with a particularly interesting issue in MVC &amp;#8211; I found the solution on Rick Strahl’s blog. Specifically I was trying to change the values of a view model from a controller action, after PostBack &amp;#8211; yet my changes seemed to be ignored or simply refuse to stick. Turns out the HtmlHelpers refer to the actual POST data on page load after postback (seemingly ignoring the “model” even though you explicitly refer to the model when using HtmlHelpers).</description>

      <description>An oldie but a goodie made a comeback and was proved useful &amp;#8211; Visual Event, a bookmarklet that lets you view javascript events on a page with a nice visual overlay.
Great article on using REMs instead of EMs when font sizing. Specifcally, the article goes into detail on ditching pixel specification altogether (except for sprites and very specific instances) and using %, em, and rem universally.
Clover 2 is a nice small app that wraps Explorer and adds Chrome-like tabs to the interface.</description>

var myvar = something_else ?? “default_value”;
myvar will be set to something_else only if something_else is not null, otherwise it will be &amp;#8220;default_value&amp;#8221; instead.</description>

      <description>Did a lot of cleanup and additional (new) functionality for Fill the Part.
Created a really need widget that loads activity stream every 25secs, loading newest at top with a sliding stack animation, while the bottom one slides up (squished).
Continued to play with jsRender.</description>

      <description>Fresh on the heels of my failure with Knockout, I continued my OOP and data-bound JavaScript development. I also discovered Angular.js this week (by Google). This looks like it&amp;#8217;s a much cleaner and easier (read: less clunky) way of doing what Knockout.js does. It also looks like this might be pretty easy for me to implement into my existing project. Also, from a staying power perspective, it&amp;#8217;s probably safe to assume since Google is officially backing (and created) that it will be around for a while.</description>

      <description>This week was all about Knockout.js and my seemingly total lack of understanding of javascript and jquery! After struggling with Knockout (rather, struggling to implement it into an existing project that might be a little too complex for my first attempt with KO) I decided to back burner it for a while. However I did learn a lot more about dealing with data, json, and oop in general with javascript and jquery.</description>

      <description>VACATION!! Didn&amp;#8217;t learn much, but did read up some more on XNA programming in general. Rode a wave runner (jet ski) for the first time and that was exhilarating! (Although it was extremely tiring, and very hard work!) Rode lots of rides, ate like shit, and had a great time!</description>

      <description>This week and the past have been spent a lot with XNA 4.0 (Xbox Live Indie game development). I did a little bit of work on a project and started looking for good sprite assets for a test game. My idea is to create a DayZ type game but overhead 2D using Zombies Ate My Neighbors! style graphics (in fact the actual sprite sheets from that game itself). Found some great resources for the sprites.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog! This blog is just going to be a weekly/daily journal of sorts, logging all of my discoveries and observations on the Internet and related to development in general. Of course, expect some anecdotes on gaming and life as well!
 Integrated a Twitter feed into the UGM website. Used a tiny bit of jQuery animate to slide the feed bar out from the left side of the screen.</description>

      <description>First let me get this out of the way to perhaps add some credibility to this review: I am a hardcore gamer and have nearly 30 titles in my Xbox 360 library. I also have a PS3 (although my primary gaming console is the 360). Ive been gaming since I can remember (got a NES for Christmas, had an Atari 2600 etc). With that being said, let me also mention that I have a 4 year old son who is absolutely addicted to Angry Birds on my iPhone, although he&amp;#8217;s not really a fan of using a controller &amp;#8211; just yet.</description>

      <description>Here is a complete list of my Fiction reading list for 2010:
 Child of Fire &amp;#8211; great &amp;#8211; first in a new series! Oblivion Society &amp;#8211; decent &amp;#8211; post apocalyptic, very very strange and not sure if I liked this one. Some of the dialog was just cheesy and bad! Hunger Games &amp;#8211; great &amp;#8211; my first YA novel and a very very good one. (first part of a trilogy) Fragment &amp;#8211; good &amp;#8211; Crichton-esque book similar to Jurassic Park &amp;#8211; although very much unbelievable but fun none the less.</description>

      <description>I just got a brand new PS3 (slim) last night! Needless to say I was excited and eager to get it setup and online. The actual setup was a breeze, thanks to HDMI cables and the quick and easy interface of the actual PS3. However, once I got to the network configuration part – what should have seemingly been a trivial experience quickly became an exercise in frustration!
Essentially what kept happening was that I would scan for wireless networks, find my network, select it, enter a WEP key and then it would hang for about 3 minutes trying to obtain an IP address, but ultimately fail.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m the type of person that tends to bookmark like crazy. To the point that my bookmarks is basically just a collection of every website on the internet. So when I come across a site that I _really _want to remember, I simply drag an icon to my desktop and have them horizontally aligned across the bottom of my second monitor. However, that list of icons is starting to grow. So I figured I would create a post whenever I clean up that stack of icons and share with the world!</description>
