      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a full time remote worker for most of the past year, I realized that I had to get off my butt more so I took the plunge and started standing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things when writing code is the quality with which you write it. Quality can be subjective so its important to adhere to a few basic standards and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do rapid releases at AWeber so we’re constantly pushing code changes to our users. To be sure that we aren’t in a constant state of “fix 1 bug, introduce 2 more” we embrace TDD across our entire stack. This includes making sure our front-end JavaScript code has thorough test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been noticing a trend with my skill set &amp;#8211; its been increasing which is always great, but also starting to veer in directions that are alternate to that of a typical “.net developer”. I say this because, for all intents and purposes, I am a typical “.net developer”. Every recruiter I get a call from always has a “great .net opportunity that you would be perfect for!”. I&amp;#8217;ve always prided myself on this notion, always considered myself a .</description>

      <description>Shortly after getting my Chromebook, I quickly realized that it was a bit lacking. Sure, I wrote earlier that its a great little device and perfect for surfing &amp;#8211; but I also sort of wanted something a tiny bit more. So a little bit of searching lead me toan article explaining how you can very easily install Ubuntu Linux (well a port specifically for Chromebooks) on the device! The process itself was super painless and very easy.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re like me, you have a fair amount of sites that you visit on a daily basis. Personally, I love the Bookmark bar (on Chrome, Firefox, etc). However, you cant really fit a whole lot of sites before you hit the end (width) of the browser and typically get the double arrow &amp;#8220;more&amp;#8221; dropdown.
Well a quick tip is to simply remove the text for all of the bookmarks that have a favicon set (which is probably 90% of them).</description>

      <description>Found a neat little JavaScript tool (that&amp;#8217;s right, Vanilla!) called Enquire.js for detecting Media Query triggers in CSS. This could be cool for triggering events (like animation) when you have certain components of your page depending on different media queries. Even though those triggers typically only occur on resize/resolution change &amp;#8211; it could also be used to detect orientation change (i.e. iPad rotate from portrait to landscape).
While researching some stuff for an upcoming mobile web app I need to create I found this handy JavaScript tool for storing to Local Storage called jStorage.</description>

      <description>The .Net framework 2012.2 update has been released. Most of this update has to do with a few minor tweaks and enhancements (color coding popular client-side templates, LESS support, etc) as well as some new templates. A great post on John Papa’s blog outlines the templates.
Played Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and have to say I&amp;#8217;m a little disappointed. Its definitely not Bayonetta, and I doubt Platinum will ever achieve the stunning awesomeness that was that game, but heres holding out hope (not much since last I heard Bayonetta 2 was WiiU exclusive).</description>

      <description>While watching the excellent course on Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery by John Papa over at PluralSight, he dropped a nice little nugget of information that I was totally unaware of.
You can add debugger; as a line by itself in your JavaScript and when your code gets executed by the browser, the browsers built in debugger will stop on that line. Think of it as a way to throw breakpoints right into your code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been doing Crossfit for exactly 4 months now. In that time I have seen and experienced a tremendous improvement in my physical fitness and strength. However, I’m still a noob. And never is it more obvious than at the very end of each workout session. I always, consistently, finish in last place. While there is never a feeling of pressure or intense competition, they do post the scores on the whiteboard, and there are leader-boards and you just can’t help but notice when you finish last!</description>

      <description>Created a super basic/handy lift calculator &amp;#8211; I’ll use this initially during my first bunch of sessions until I get comfortable doing the math on the fly. Its just painful trying to do percentage calculations while lifting, and then breaking down those results into how many different weights you need to add to each side of the bar! This tool will compute all of that in one shot!
My Crossfit box started using Wodify.</description>

      <description>This is probably going to be one of my last posts for 2012 so I decided to end with a list of my goals and ambitions for the next year! Personally, I think its very important to always have goals and something to look forward to, but also as something to continuously drive yourself to improve. A goal is a destination, and without a destination you&amp;#8217;re just travelling aimlessly with no clear direction or indication of where to go so, ultimately, you wind up nowhere (or right back where you started).</description>

      <description>I’m sure you&amp;#8217;ve encountered this problem: you visit one of your favorite sites, and your password is saved in the password box automatically by your browser, but you completely forget what that password actually is! Good thing your browser is synced and you don&amp;#8217;t really need to worry about it. Well, here&amp;#8217;s a quick tip that will allow you to access that password very easily.
Using any current browser that has Developer tools, access those (F12 usually) and find the Inspector.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve always been interested in some sort of Microsoft certification, and have always had it in the back of my mind to try to complete one of them. This morning I discovered a new track that is perfect and right up my alley; MCSD: Web Applications Developer. Most of the preparation for these exams can be completed via Pluralsight &amp;#8211; so I’m definitely going to try to commit to at least attempting this certification.</description>

      <description>When I started my new job, a few months in I decided to start blogging. At first it really was just for my own personal use, a way for me to keep track of my accomplishments and new things I’d learned. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to get too bogged down and distracted with the trouble of actually creating a blog and designing it &amp;#8211; so instead I created a simple Google document and logged stuff daily and/or weekly.</description>
