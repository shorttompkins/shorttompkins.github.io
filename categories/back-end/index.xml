      <description>For the past few months I&amp;#8217;ve been seeing more and more about node.js popping up all over the place. I installed it and dabbled a few months ago, but never really spent more than an hour and honestly didn&amp;#8217;t walk away very impressed (my own fault, really). This past week I decided to really give it another shot, really trying to dig into it and actually accomplish something. This also sparked by my discovery of Koding.</description>

      <description>Found a neat little JavaScript tool (that&amp;#8217;s right, Vanilla!) called Enquire.js for detecting Media Query triggers in CSS. This could be cool for triggering events (like animation) when you have certain components of your page depending on different media queries. Even though those triggers typically only occur on resize/resolution change &amp;#8211; it could also be used to detect orientation change (i.e. iPad rotate from portrait to landscape).
While researching some stuff for an upcoming mobile web app I need to create I found this handy JavaScript tool for storing to Local Storage called jStorage.</description>

      <description>I started going through the process of deconstructing John Papa’s amazing CodeCamper Single Page Application project and trying to break it down to a basic stripped down project template. I love a lot of what was accomplished in that project (great DI, awesome Repositories and patterns, etc.)! While breaking down the project, I&amp;#8217;ve learned quite a bit. I&amp;#8217;ve posted the full source of the template to my github, but its still a work in progress.</description>

      <description>The .Net framework 2012.2 update has been released. Most of this update has to do with a few minor tweaks and enhancements (color coding popular client-side templates, LESS support, etc) as well as some new templates. A great post on John Papa’s blog outlines the templates.
Played Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and have to say I&amp;#8217;m a little disappointed. Its definitely not Bayonetta, and I doubt Platinum will ever achieve the stunning awesomeness that was that game, but heres holding out hope (not much since last I heard Bayonetta 2 was WiiU exclusive).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a Backbone.js application for a few days now, and I really feel like I’m finally getting the hang of it. I&amp;#8217;ve run into a few snags here and there but for the most part I&amp;#8217;ve been pushing ahead and my application is coming together nicely. I hope to do a post with the entire source code and a heavy breakdown of each area of the code and functionality.</description>

      <description>Was playing with animating some stuff on a page and started trying to work with animating box-shadow. I realized it wasn&amp;#8217;t working and after some research figured out that it just doesn&amp;#8217;t work. A super handy and easy plugin solves that problem though.
The latest episode of the Suburban Strength Coach podcast is up!
Started watching the Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery on Pluralsight with my team at work.</description>

      <description>Had a great Christmas/New Years break (well went back to work for 2 days in between there)!! Enjoyed the time off and just spending time with the little one and generally doing nothing productive!
I did find time during the break to spend an entire day working with @Answer7 doing a little mini hackathon! This was something that we have been toying with for a while &amp;#8211; the basic premise is that you and a few friends lock yourself in a room for an entire day and try to create something from scratch!</description>

      <description>Forgot to mention I picked up Far Cry 3 last week and I&amp;#8217;ve been playing it a lot. Its really a fun game. Very open ended, very sandbox. It seems like they finally nailed the balance with the island, the open ended gameplay, gun play, and fun action (I wanted so much to love Far Cry 2 but it just never happened). There are definitely moments where I’m reminded of Skyrim, which is a good thing!</description>

      <description>Busted my ass in a major workout last night at Crossfit. The regular class is NO JOKE!
Oh yeah, and Obama won (again)!!!
Decided to try another stab at Angular.js this week. Going to try to lab something up at work using it, something real-world like article comments or something.
Continued working on the new Nextgen.com framework. Got the shell set up pretty nicely and did a lot of organization of all Javascript and CSS and how it will be integrated globally and sitewide.</description>

      <description>After a discussion about the advantages of N-tier archictecture with a coworker and finally truly understanding it all &amp;#8211; I rewrote the backend for &amp;#8220;Secret&amp;#8221; website to fully utilize a Data, Services, Domain, UI architecture. Now it is coming together quite nicely. I’ve completed the basic groundwork for most of the backend, with the Data layer completed, the Repositories at a good start with most basic CRUD functionality complete, and the Services layer tapping into those repositories.</description>

      <description>Started coding &amp;#8220;Secret&amp;#8221; website (still not happy with the name)!! Going with a basic 3 tier structure for now &amp;#8211; Domain, Services, and UX. Made good progress so far on the Domain model, and the underlying foundation for the Services layer.
Found and worked with a great tiny little jQuery plugin for working with cookies. Was super easy to use and implemented, and even worked with jQuery 1.3 in a legacy system I needed it in!</description>

      <description>Absolute total nightmare at the end of the week as we pushed a new build to production and were impacted with a ton of problems. Mainly the issue resides in the fact that the current setup of the applications is a configuration/deployment nightmare &amp;#8211; with way too many steps and settings involved leading to way too many opened ended possibilities for user error.
Learned about the [attr] selector in jQuery &amp;#8211; basically to detect the presense of an actual attribute in an html element.</description>

      <description>After being stumped for a while with a particularly interesting issue in MVC &amp;#8211; I found the solution on Rick Strahl’s blog. Specifically I was trying to change the values of a view model from a controller action, after PostBack &amp;#8211; yet my changes seemed to be ignored or simply refuse to stick. Turns out the HtmlHelpers refer to the actual POST data on page load after postback (seemingly ignoring the “model” even though you explicitly refer to the model when using HtmlHelpers).</description>

Continued developing business plan for “Secret” website (created survey questions, etc.). Researched payment processing for site and discovered Amazon Payments offers better rates than Paypal once you get into the higher sales volume (greater than 10k).

      <description>Created and launched TumblingInferno.com. Was an awesome rapid prototype going from start to launch in 2 days. Implemented a lot of LINQ which was great experience as well as reacquainting myself with Entity Framework. Super excited that I was finally able to finish and launch something!
Attempted to play with Angular.js, and was somewhat successful. Although didnt really work for the project the way I was hoping &amp;#8211; and help online is scarce currently.</description>
