      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve been spending a lot of my free time absorbing as much as I can about an exciting Functional Programming language called Elixir.  For those of you that don&amp;#8217;t know, Elixir is somewhat of a spiritual successor to Ruby, and therefore Phoenix (the web framework for Elixir) could be considered it&amp;#8217;s Rails.  Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at my learning path and what you can do if you&amp;#8217;re interested in becoming a proficient Elixir &amp;amp; Phoenix developer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago I &lt;a href=&#34;https://kroltech.com/2015/10/15/getting-started-with-react-and-flux/&#34;&gt;started an ambitious project&lt;/a&gt; to create a website from scratch using React and Flux (Redux) as well as Node.js and MongoDB.  I was also writing a companion book parallel to writing the actual code for the project and made some really good progress.  Since I basically stopped completely and just let the book sit and linger, I decided that I should at least open source the book so you can check it out and hopefully learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to receive a review copy of Backbone.js Patterns and Best Practices directly from the author. It’s a decent book, and a great ‘next step’ for anyone thats a budding Backbone developer that has got the basics down and wants to take their skills to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have a simple jQuery onClick event bound to a link. On the load of the page, I fetch existing data from a cookie and then call the onClick manually to setup the page (for returning visitors). There is some animation associated with the click &amp;#8211; but when the page loads and all of the clicks are registered, the animations look odd and out of sync (and just logically dont make sense in that situation).</description>

      <description>While I continue to work on the mobile application I’m creating for work, I rewrote the entire framework so that its much better organized. I also decided to integrate Marionette.js which was absolutely worth while. It took a little bit to figure it out, but the savings in time after the fact are huge! Writing simple views and collections now is a no brainer (almost to the point that I feel bad because it feels like cheating!</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a quick tip. If you have text that contains urls (i.e. tweets) and want the urls in the text to appear as actual links via HTML, use the following RegEx:
[sourcecode lang=&amp;#8221;javascript&amp;#8221;]
var message = &amp;ldquo;Here is some tweet text. Check out: http://www.google.com&amp;quot;;
var exp = /(b(https?|ftp|file)://[-A-Z0-9+&amp;amp;@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Z0-9+&amp;amp;@#/%=~_|])/ig;
message = message.replace(exp, &amp;ldquo;$1&amp;rdquo;);
[/sourcecode]

      <description>Great article on why there aren&amp;#8217;t more great “web apps” and the difference between an “App” and an “app”. Dan Whalin provides us an excellent introduction to AngularJS. The video is about 60 minutes, but covers a lot of ground and is a great introduction. After I&amp;#8217;ve been spending some time with Backbone, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking more and more about maybe making the move onto Angular or Ember &amp;#8211; a lot of the Microsoft evangelists seem to be pushing Angular lately &amp;#8211; Pluralsight courses are coming very soon!</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working on a project, that requires a number of different animations based on user events. I recently switched all of the animations to CSS3 transforms and transitions versus jQuery animations. The improvement has been staggering, to say the least.
However, I came across a weird issue today. When attempting to fade an element in after a click event, the element just kept popping into place. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t fade. After some investigation I realized that my jQuery was setting the opacity to 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working hard on preparing a mobile app prototype for a demonstration/proposal next week. The goal is to create a native app using HTML5 and PhoneGap. I&amp;#8217;ve been building the app using Backbone primarily, and using Adobe’s PhoneGap Build. PhoneGap Build is a cloud based compilation tool that makes things VERY easy to get your app up and running natively. The build tool supports iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, HP, and a few others.</description>

      <description>I completed the Code School course on using Google Chrome Dev Tools. I highly recommend you complete this course &amp;#8211; its super quick (probably no longer than 1 hour) and very easy. Yet, I learned a lot. Specifically with the more advanced topics of the dev tools like Profiling, Memory Leaks, Framerates, etc.
Started writing my hybrid mobile app for work &amp;#8211; learned quite a bit along the way. Working with jQuery Mobile, but its overhead and conventions/takeover is making it less than desirable &amp;#8211; perhaps I’ll rewrite the transition animations manually and implement 3rd party Touch/Tap library.</description>

      <description>This post is the conclusion to the article Building a web app using Backbone.js and require.js &amp;#8211; Part 1. Please be sure to read that article first before proceeding.  In my previous post, we discussed the original idea for the project, outlined what its supposed to do, and started dissecting the project&amp;#8217;s main.js and app.js files. Both of those files frequently referred to the &amp;#8220;Games&amp;#8221; Backbone view and collection, but never really explained them.</description>

      <description>Found a neat little JavaScript tool (that&amp;#8217;s right, Vanilla!) called Enquire.js for detecting Media Query triggers in CSS. This could be cool for triggering events (like animation) when you have certain components of your page depending on different media queries. Even though those triggers typically only occur on resize/resolution change &amp;#8211; it could also be used to detect orientation change (i.e. iPad rotate from portrait to landscape).
While researching some stuff for an upcoming mobile web app I need to create I found this handy JavaScript tool for storing to Local Storage called jStorage.</description>

      <description>Perhaps this is common knowledge, but I just figured it out (accidentally) and its pretty damn awesome! If you maintain a regular .js file, and then create a copy of it .min.js with a compressed copy of your code, Visual Studio will maintain that minified version automatically whenever you make changes to your original! It will create a .map file that it uses to keep track of the differences between your source and minified versions (variable names, etc).</description>

      <description>Some teammates were surfing around looking for some inspiration and found an agency website that does some truly incredible work: http://nclud.com Notably are their BeerCamp websites they create: http://2012.beercamp.com, http://2013.beercamp.com &amp;#8211; the 2013 website is actually a full on multiplayer game (similar to the original Mario Bros. game on Atari). Very inspirational!!
While poking around the source code for the 2013 Beercamp website game I discovered Raphael.js, a simple JavaScript library that makes working with vector in HTML a breeze!</description>

      <description>I continue to plug away at my Backbone.js project (rewriting imgettin.it from scratch basically). I&amp;#8217;ve hit a shitload of road blocks, but most of them were related to my having to completely rethink how to handle a certain area or aspect to make it more efficient &amp;#8211; and then wrap my head around how to accomplish this new concept using Backbone.js. I would say its taken me probably a solid 4-6 nights of coding to get to the point that I don’t feel utterly lost and coding is coming more fluent now (versus stutters as with most new languages/concepts).</description>

      <description>I started going through the process of deconstructing John Papa’s amazing CodeCamper Single Page Application project and trying to break it down to a basic stripped down project template. I love a lot of what was accomplished in that project (great DI, awesome Repositories and patterns, etc.)! While breaking down the project, I&amp;#8217;ve learned quite a bit. I&amp;#8217;ve posted the full source of the template to my github, but its still a work in progress.</description>

      <description>While playing with the SPA project template (post forthcoming) I finally took some time to play around with Require.js. While its fairly easy to get started, it blew my mind how it almost instantly changed my mindset and habits with regard to organization of my code. At its most basic level, it allows you to break all of your code down into nice bite-sized chunks in individual files &amp;#8211; but its so much more.</description>

      <description>The .Net framework 2012.2 update has been released. Most of this update has to do with a few minor tweaks and enhancements (color coding popular client-side templates, LESS support, etc) as well as some new templates. A great post on John Papa’s blog outlines the templates.
Played Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and have to say I&amp;#8217;m a little disappointed. Its definitely not Bayonetta, and I doubt Platinum will ever achieve the stunning awesomeness that was that game, but heres holding out hope (not much since last I heard Bayonetta 2 was WiiU exclusive).</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve run into a few snags here and there but for the most part I&amp;#8217;ve been pushing ahead and my application is coming together nicely. I hope to do a post with the entire source code and a heavy breakdown of each area of the code and functionality.</description>

Why have I never seen/heard of that before and certainly why wasn&amp;#8217;t I doing it regularly (and why hadn&amp;#8217;t I thought of it to be honest).
Instead of doing this:

      <description>Was playing with animating some stuff on a page and started trying to work with animating box-shadow. I realized it wasn&amp;#8217;t working and after some research figured out that it just doesn&amp;#8217;t work. A super handy and easy plugin solves that problem though.

      <description>While watching the excellent course on Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery by John Papa over at PluralSight, he dropped a nice little nugget of information that I was totally unaware of.
You can add debugger; as a line by itself in your JavaScript and when your code gets executed by the browser, the browsers built in debugger will stop on that line. Think of it as a way to throw breakpoints right into your code.</description>

      <description>Created a super basic/handy lift calculator &amp;#8211; I’ll use this initially during my first bunch of sessions until I get comfortable doing the math on the fly. Its just painful trying to do percentage calculations while lifting, and then breaking down those results into how many different weights you need to add to each side of the bar! This tool will compute all of that in one shot!

      <description>Soft launched ImGettin.it over the weekend! By soft launch, I mean, bought and setup the domain, and got a test version of the site live. Login works, and the site “works” for the most part, but is very much not ready for prime time yet. I still need to get a lot of things working and most importantly I need a basic admin for the games database. The data that&amp;#8217;s up right now is just test seed data &amp;#8211; while pretty solid is far from complete or even valid.</description>

      <description>I was searching for the opposite of the caret, or circumflex, character (^) and couldn&amp;#8217;t really find one. Typically, in a pinch when I&amp;#8217;m mocking, I would just use the caret ^ and a lowercase v &amp;#8211; but they don&amp;#8217;t look the same.
There doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a good opposite for the caret character &amp;#8211; but I found 2 extremely useful HTML character codes to use instead:

Initially I started using Underscore.js thinking this would help, but in the interest of time (had to get it done today!!!!) I decided to just do it quick and dirty. Well, I succeeded in the dirty department:</description>

I did find time during the break to spend an entire day working with @Answer7 doing a little mini hackathon! This was something that we have been toying with for a while &amp;#8211; the basic premise is that you and a few friends lock yourself in a room for an entire day and try to create something from scratch!</description>

[sourcecode lang=&amp;#8221;html&amp;#8221;]
 Item 1 Item 1 Item 1  [/sourcecode]
When the rows would naturally wrap, there was a tiny gap between rows (as if there was a top margin or padding).</description>

      <description>So I spent most of 2 days working through trying to figure out Ember.js. (I know previously I said I was going to focus on Backbone, but I wanted to stick with Ember one more day and try to see it through.) Granted, I’m totally new to this whole MV* side of JavaScript. I had decided that Ember was just the way to go. Sadly, after 2 full days of playing around I&amp;#8217;ve given up (for now) and decided to start focusing on Backbone.</description>

Looks like we might have a real project at work to use the Kinect with: our users group meeting we host every year, with over 5000 in attendance. I came up with an idea that I think might be pretty interesting, all really for the purposes of allowing me an opportunity to work with the Kinect.</description>

      <description>Forgot to mention I picked up Far Cry 3 last week and I&amp;#8217;ve been playing it a lot. Its really a fun game. Very open ended, very sandbox. It seems like they finally nailed the balance with the island, the open ended gameplay, gun play, and fun action (I wanted so much to love Far Cry 2 but it just never happened). There are definitely moments where I’m reminded of Skyrim, which is a good thing!</description>

      <description>My second JavaScript library in as many days! This new one is called ShiftPanes (like my original names huh?!). Basically, it allows you to declare a container that will hold &amp;#8220;pageable&amp;#8221; blocks of content within it. It is, again, pretty basic and no frills.
Just declare a container with any class you want, and inside declare multiple containers each with the same (different from the container) class that will act as “panes” (or pages).</description>

      <description>This is my first ever public JavaScript “library” and also my first GitHub!
SlideIns.js is just simple jQuery code that allows you to have content on a page “slide in” from left, right, or middle (middle just fades in basically). This concept was taken from Apple.com pages, where they recently started having little subtle animations featured on their pages &amp;#8211; for example as you scroll down an iPad or iPhone might slide in from the right of the screen.</description>

      <description>I finally figured out how to use closures properly in JavaScript. This came as a result of my needing to make sure globals I was defining in different script files weren&amp;#8217;t conflicting with same named globals in other files. My solution was rather simple, just wrap existing chunks of code in their own function wrapper:
Original Code:
Note that the variables globalVar and anotherGlobal are truly GLOBAL and any other javascript file(s) with the same variables declared will cause major issues for our code (or vise versa).</description>

      <title>$(document).ready() versus $(window).load()</title>

      <description>As a force of habit, I&amp;#8217;ve always just wrapped my JavaScript code in a $(document).ready() and assumed/hoped for the best. I know that this is specifically for when the DOM is ready, and doesn&amp;#8217;t have anything to do with images. However, 99% of the time I&amp;#8217;ve never really been concerned about the status of loaded images.
Today, I came across an issue where during the $(document).ready() I needed to get the TOP position property of an  element.</description>

      <description>My continued use of My Fitness Pal (nutrition tracking app) has veered dangerously close to obsession! Literally, it&amp;#8217;s become something of a game. I’m constantly looking at the details on every food and considering how it will effect my “stats” (seriously, as if I’m an MMO character or something)! Ultimately, that&amp;#8217;s a good thing I guess. This past weekend alone I&amp;#8217;ve been doing REALLY really well with my eating. I have a great schedule of meals lined up for the week too, with high protein days stacked for Tuesday and Thursday (Crossfit days).</description>

      <description>Installed Web Essentials 1.7 for VS2012 at home and tried out Zen Coding. This is definitely something really awesome and something I wish was integrated a long time ago. As it stands, I don&amp;#8217;t know how much “raw html” I will be coding in the near future to warrant using it all that much &amp;#8211; but I guess any html coding is worth doing via Zen Coding!
Finally spent some time and started doing the Pluralsight course on Backbone.</description>

      <description>Busted my ass in a major workout last night at Crossfit. The regular class is NO JOKE!
Oh yeah, and Obama won (again)!!!
Decided to try another stab at Angular.js this week. Going to try to lab something up at work using it, something real-world like article comments or something.
Continued working on the new Nextgen.com framework. Got the shell set up pretty nicely and did a lot of organization of all Javascript and CSS and how it will be integrated globally and sitewide.</description>

      <description>Started coding &amp;#8220;Secret&amp;#8221; website (still not happy with the name)!! Going with a basic 3 tier structure for now &amp;#8211; Domain, Services, and UX. Made good progress so far on the Domain model, and the underlying foundation for the Services layer.
Found and worked with a great tiny little jQuery plugin for working with cookies. Was super easy to use and implemented, and even worked with jQuery 1.3 in a legacy system I needed it in!</description>

      <description>Absolute total nightmare at the end of the week as we pushed a new build to production and were impacted with a ton of problems. Mainly the issue resides in the fact that the current setup of the applications is a configuration/deployment nightmare &amp;#8211; with way too many steps and settings involved leading to way too many opened ended possibilities for user error.
Learned about the [attr] selector in jQuery &amp;#8211; basically to detect the presense of an actual attribute in an html element.</description>

      <description>Attended a Philly Tech Meetup in Center City (Market Street &amp;#8211; Science Center). Was very informative, and definitely will not be the last!
Learned about autocomplete=”off” as an HTML attribute. Was having an issue with validation where the browser was prepopulating the New Password field in the form with what was saved for the users login credentials. This was throwing the error because New Password (auto completed) didnt match the corresponding Confirm Password (which was naturally blank).</description>

      <description>After being stumped for a while with a particularly interesting issue in MVC &amp;#8211; I found the solution on Rick Strahl’s blog. Specifically I was trying to change the values of a view model from a controller action, after PostBack &amp;#8211; yet my changes seemed to be ignored or simply refuse to stick. Turns out the HtmlHelpers refer to the actual POST data on page load after postback (seemingly ignoring the “model” even though you explicitly refer to the model when using HtmlHelpers).</description>

      <description>An oldie but a goodie made a comeback and was proved useful &amp;#8211; Visual Event, a bookmarklet that lets you view javascript events on a page with a nice visual overlay.
Great article on using REMs instead of EMs when font sizing. Specifcally, the article goes into detail on ditching pixel specification altogether (except for sprites and very specific instances) and using %, em, and rem universally.
Clover 2 is a nice small app that wraps Explorer and adds Chrome-like tabs to the interface.</description>

      <description>Created and launched TumblingInferno.com. Was an awesome rapid prototype going from start to launch in 2 days. Implemented a lot of LINQ which was great experience as well as reacquainting myself with Entity Framework. Super excited that I was finally able to finish and launch something!
Attempted to play with Angular.js, and was somewhat successful. Although didnt really work for the project the way I was hoping &amp;#8211; and help online is scarce currently.</description>

      <description>Fresh on the heels of my failure with Knockout, I continued my OOP and data-bound JavaScript development. I also discovered Angular.js this week (by Google). This looks like it&amp;#8217;s a much cleaner and easier (read: less clunky) way of doing what Knockout.js does. It also looks like this might be pretty easy for me to implement into my existing project. Also, from a staying power perspective, it&amp;#8217;s probably safe to assume since Google is officially backing (and created) that it will be around for a while.</description>

      <description>This week was all about Knockout.js and my seemingly total lack of understanding of javascript and jquery! After struggling with Knockout (rather, struggling to implement it into an existing project that might be a little too complex for my first attempt with KO) I decided to back burner it for a while. However I did learn a lot more about dealing with data, json, and oop in general with javascript and jquery.</description>

      <description>This week and the past have been spent a lot with XNA 4.0 (Xbox Live Indie game development). I did a little bit of work on a project and started looking for good sprite assets for a test game. My idea is to create a DayZ type game but overhead 2D using Zombies Ate My Neighbors! style graphics (in fact the actual sprite sheets from that game itself). Found some great resources for the sprites.</description>
