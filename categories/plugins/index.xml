      <description>I went on a bit of a shopping spree on Amazon. Besides a few Kindle books (sci-fi, etc) I grabbed a few new JavaScript books as well:
JavaScript Patterns &amp;#8211; Stoyan Stefanov
Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja &amp;#8211; John Resig, Bear Bibeault
If you are looking to utterly destroy an entire afternoon (or more), definitely check out the HTML5 version of an oldie but goodie, Free Rider HD!! (also know as Canvas Rider)</description>

      <description>Was playing with animating some stuff on a page and started trying to work with animating box-shadow. I realized it wasn&amp;#8217;t working and after some research figured out that it just doesn&amp;#8217;t work. A super handy and easy plugin solves that problem though.
The latest episode of the Suburban Strength Coach podcast is up!
Started watching the Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery on Pluralsight with my team at work.</description>

      <description>Soft launched ImGettin.it over the weekend! By soft launch, I mean, bought and setup the domain, and got a test version of the site live. Login works, and the site “works” for the most part, but is very much not ready for prime time yet. I still need to get a lot of things working and most importantly I need a basic admin for the games database. The data that&amp;#8217;s up right now is just test seed data &amp;#8211; while pretty solid is far from complete or even valid.</description>
