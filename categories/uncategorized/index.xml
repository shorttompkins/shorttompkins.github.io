      <description>Wow! Looking back, this was quite literally a whirlwind year for me! Honestly, the main theme of this year really was self-discovery, learning, and growth! Where to begin&amp;#8230;
At the very end of last year, I personally felt that my passion for my business/partnership was on the downturn. I was struggling with if I even wanted to do it anymore. Then, one of our biggest clients basically told us they were hiring someone full-time and bringing all the work in-house.</description>

      <description>Just when I started wondering about doing sprints (and in fact did some 2 weeks ago at the park) they posted on my Crossfit website about the benefits of sprinting and a link to this article. Sounds good to me! Will incorporate for sure on Saturday/Sunday mornings (my non-Crossfit “home based” workout day).
Great blog post on vitamins and supplements to take pre/post workout as well as daily. After some research and discussing with one of the Crossfit coaches, this is my current plan:</description>

      <description>When I started my new job, a few months in I decided to start blogging. At first it really was just for my own personal use, a way for me to keep track of my accomplishments and new things I’d learned. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to get too bogged down and distracted with the trouble of actually creating a blog and designing it &amp;#8211; so instead I created a simple Google document and logged stuff daily and/or weekly.</description>

      <description>Here is a complete list of my Fiction reading list for 2010:
 Child of Fire &amp;#8211; great &amp;#8211; first in a new series! Oblivion Society &amp;#8211; decent &amp;#8211; post apocalyptic, very very strange and not sure if I liked this one. Some of the dialog was just cheesy and bad! Hunger Games &amp;#8211; great &amp;#8211; my first YA novel and a very very good one. (first part of a trilogy) Fragment &amp;#8211; good &amp;#8211; Crichton-esque book similar to Jurassic Park &amp;#8211; although very much unbelievable but fun none the less.</description>

      <description>I just got a brand new PS3 (slim) last night! Needless to say I was excited and eager to get it setup and online. The actual setup was a breeze, thanks to HDMI cables and the quick and easy interface of the actual PS3. However, once I got to the network configuration part – what should have seemingly been a trivial experience quickly became an exercise in frustration!
Essentially what kept happening was that I would scan for wireless networks, find my network, select it, enter a WEP key and then it would hang for about 3 minutes trying to obtain an IP address, but ultimately fail.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m the type of person that tends to bookmark like crazy. To the point that my bookmarks is basically just a collection of every website on the internet. So when I come across a site that I _really _want to remember, I simply drag an icon to my desktop and have them horizontally aligned across the bottom of my second monitor. However, that list of icons is starting to grow. So I figured I would create a post whenever I clean up that stack of icons and share with the world!</description>
